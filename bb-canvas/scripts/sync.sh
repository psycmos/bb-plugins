# Copies bb-canvas's source into <plugin>/vendor/bb-canvas/ of every plugin
# that uses it: the Canvas plugin gets lib/ and components/; crew and Graph
# Studio only build layers for it, so they get lib/ alone (BBP-193). The copy is checked in: a plugin is built and
# installed on its own (path: or marketplace source), so it must never import
# from outside its folder. Each plugin's vendor-drift test fails when the copy
# and this source differ — run this script after every change here.
